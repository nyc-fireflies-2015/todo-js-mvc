Minimal TODO app
================

Everybody loves TODO lists (apparently.)

This app is of limited use as it does not store data but it does demonstrate one approach to doing MVC in Javascript.

TodoList and Task are our models
View is the view
Controller is the controller


TODO:
- Add data storage
- Convert the view to use handlebars / mustache / something
- Use modules (or similar) to hide our functions from the global namespace as far as possible
